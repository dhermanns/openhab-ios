removing entry for "LSRequiresIPhoneOS" - not supported on macOS
adding entry for "NSSupportsAutomaticTermination" => 1
adding entry for "NSSupportsSuddenTermination" => 1
error: 'LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace = NO' is not supported on macOS. Either remove the entry or set it to YES, and also ensure that the application does open documents in place on macOS. (in target 'openHAB' from project 'openHAB')

* The app is now ready for iOS 13:
    * It supports the beautiful Dark Mode
    
* Improvements relevant to users
    * Implemented haptic feedback when buttons are pressed. Note, this is only available from iPhone 7 onwards
    * Enhanced the colorpicker, so that it is easier to select the desired color
    * Optimized screen usage, so that more information can be displayed
    * Changed order of the rollershutter button
    * Fixed backwards compatibility with OpenHAB 1.x connections
    * Enhanced video component by adding mjpeg support
    * Improved the representation of the rollershutter component
    * Enhanced authentication process for remote and local connections. This should ensure Basic Auth works in cases where the URL is discovered via Bonjour.
    * Fixed data parsing issue
    * Changed logic regards showing SSL certificate warning
    * Improved handling of sitemaps
    * Improved video URL handling on cell reuse

* Behind the scenes
    * URLSession wrapped in Alamofire for network access, AFNetworking completely removed
       * Improved handling of SSL certificate warning
       * Display of icons when connected via https
       * Setting authorization header also for icons
       * Caching of icons with Kingfisher - SDWebImage purged from code base
       * Converted direct URLSession usage in OpenHABTracker to use NetworkConnection.shared.manager instead to ensure that auth handling is handled properly - in particular when a 401 is returned from the server. 
       *  Refactored HTTP Basic Auth to use the taskDidReceiveChallenge delegate so it only includes the Authorization header if requested by the server.
       * Completed migration from AFNetworking to Alamofire: purged AlamofireRememberingSecurityPolicy.swift: init(policies: [String: ServerTrustPolicy]) to override ancestor, uncommented evaluateClientTrust and handleAuthenticationChallenge Reworked NetworkManager to it compile successfully with AlamofireRememberingSecurityPolicy Removed main.m, openHAB-Prefix.pch files, openHAB-Bridging-Header.h, openHABTests-Bridging-Header.h
       * Fixed retain cycle in setWillSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge closure
   * SFSymbols as source of icons for iOS 13 to eventually replace DynamicButton
   * Build improvements
       * Swift Package Manager to replace CocoaPod where possible
       * Improved fastlane
       * Improved test coverage for instance for large JSON files, XML trimming whitespace, improved logic
   * Many bug fixes: correct recognition of labelValue
   * Refactoring: 
       * Completed onReceiveSessionTaskChallenge and onReceiveSessionChallenge for image download
       * Recursive traversal of widgets data structure
       * Refinement of swiftlint, usage of swiftformat
       * Update to recent versions of SideMenu: clearing widgets to ensure cell invalidation on sitemap change
       * Access to UserDefaults via Preferences to avoid typing errors and improve consistency
       * Migrated from responseJSON to responseData
       * Reworked XML parsing: now completely based on Fuzi framework
       * Setting the FrameUITableViewCell font and color to match Apple's Guidelines
       * Retain cycle in loadPage fixed
       * Cache invalidation on sitemap change fixed
